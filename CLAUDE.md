# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

**`scc-dev-sphere`** is a Claude Code plugin that implements a multi-role, human-in-the-loop feature development workflow — from requirements analysis through design, AI cross-review, human approval, code implementation, and test handoff.

It does **not** have its own runtime. It composes Claude Code primitives: `skills` (slash commands), `agents` (custom subagents with role contexts), `hooks` (hard gates), and Node.js `scripts` (deterministic state/validation logic).

## Commands

This is not a traditional npm project — there is no `package.json`, no build step, no test suite for the plugin itself. The only runnable code is the Node.js scripts:

```bash
# Test script output manually
node scripts/devsphere-workflow.js <workspace-root>
node scripts/devsphere-state.js read-state <task-path>
node scripts/devsphere-state.js read-current-task <workspace-root>
node scripts/devsphere-guard.js check-implement <workspace-root>
node scripts/devsphere-guard.js check-approve <workspace-root>
node scripts/devsphere-review-matrix.js init <task-path>
node scripts/devsphere-review-matrix.js read <task-path>
node scripts/devsphere-approval.js validate-design-ready <task-path>
node scripts/devsphere-workspace.js create-feature-task <workspace-root> <task-id> [workflow-mode]
```

Scripts are dual-use: CLI-callable via `node <script>.js <command> <args>` AND `require()`-able between scripts (functions exported via `module.exports`).

### Feature task state machine

```
initialized → assessed → designing → design_ready → approved_for_implementation
→ implementation_planned → implementing → verification_ready → completed

blocked ↪ designing | implementing (resolve and re-enter)
```

Valid transitions are defined in `devsphere-guard.js` `VALID_TRANSITIONS`. Scripts enforce these — never skip states in skill prompts.

### Task workspace layout

Tasks live at `.devsphere/tasks/feature/<task-id>/` with:
```
state.json              # status, workflowMode, stages with per-stage status
inputs/                 # requirement.md
artifacts/              # business-design.md, solution-design.md, etc.
reviews/                # review-matrix.json, per-artifact review files
approvals/              # design-final-approval.json
implementation/         # implementation-plan.md, implementation-log.md
verification/           # test-handoff.md
decisions/              # per-stage decision records
evidence/               # knowledge/ and repository/ snapshots
links/                  # repos.json
```

`current-task.json` at `.devsphere/current-task.json` points to the active task.

### Design stages and their owners

| Stage | Agent | Artifact | Reviewers |
|-------|-------|----------|-----------|
| businessDesign | SA | business-design.md | SE |
| solutionDesign | SE | solution-design.md | SA, MDE, TSE |
| implementationDesign | MDE | implementation-design.md | SE, DEV, TSE |
| testDesign | TSE | test-design.md | SA, SE, MDE |
| integrated-design | — | integrated-design.md | SA, SE, MDE, TSE |

### Workflow routing

`devsphere-workflow.js` → `workflows/feature-workflow.js` reads `state.json` and returns a deterministic `nextAction` object:
- `kind: "run_skill"` → invoke the named skill with listed agents
- `kind: "human_confirm"` → present a confirmation gate to the user
- `kind: "show_status"` / `"blocked"` / `"completed"` → terminal display states

The `feature-design` skill acts as a **sub-orchestrator** — it reads stage statuses and returns which design sub-stage to advance next, then the workflow dispatches the corresponding agent.

### AI cross-review system

The review matrix (`reviews/review-matrix.json`) tracks per-artifact reviews with three issue types:
- **blocking** — must be resolved before the artifact passes
- **advisory** — recommendations, need human confirmation
- **risk_candidate** — flagged risks for human awareness

The review- revise loop: review → find issues → feedback blocking items to design agent → re-review → repeat until blocking count = 0 (max 3 rounds).

## Key conventions

### Human interaction (Chinese UI)

When presenting options to the user, **must use `AskUserQuestion`** — never plain text lists. Follow the three patterns in `references/interaction-guidelines.md`:
- `single_select` — for mutually exclusive choices
- `confirm_gate` — for high-risk confirmation gates
- `multi_select` — for non-exclusive multi-select

### State management

- State reads/writes go through `devsphere-state.js` functions — never read/write JSON files directly in skill prompts unless you're the script itself.
- After any agent produces an artifact, the `PostToolUse` hook on `Write|Edit` auto-syncs artifact existence to state.
- State transitions must pass `devsphere-guard.js check-advance` validation.
- `sync-stage-status` (in feature-workflow.js) syncs deterministic facts: artifact file exists → `drafted`, review blocking count = 0 → `ai_review_passed`.

### Agent invocation

Agents are defined as markdown files in `agents/` with YAML frontmatter (`name`, `description`). Skills reference agents by name; the workflow router specifies which agents to spawn via the `agents` array in `nextAction`.

### Script cross-dependencies

```
devsphere-state.js  ←  all other scripts (foundational I/O)
devsphere-review-matrix.js  ←  devsphere-approval.js, devsphere-workflow.js
devsphere-approval.js  ←  devsphere-workflow.js
devsphere-guard.js  ←  hooks (standalone, but imports state)
```

## Behavioral guidelines

**Tradeoff:** These guidelines bias toward caution over speed. For trivial tasks, use judgment.

### 1. Think Before Coding

**Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.**

Before implementing:
- State your assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them - don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.

### 2. Simplicity First

**Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.**

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.

Ask yourself: "Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?" If yes, simplify.

### 3. Surgical Changes

**Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.**

When editing existing code:
- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it - don't delete it.

When your changes create orphans:
- Remove imports/variables/functions that YOUR changes made unused.
- Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.

The test: Every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

### 4. Goal-Driven Execution

**Define success criteria. Loop until verified.**

Transform tasks into verifiable goals:
- "Add validation" → "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass"
- "Fix the bug" → "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass"
- "Refactor X" → "Ensure tests pass before and after"

For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan:
```
1. [Step] → verify: [check]
2. [Step] → verify: [check]
3. [Step] → verify: [check]
```

Strong success criteria let you loop independently. Weak criteria ("make it work") require constant clarification.

**These guidelines are working if:** fewer unnecessary changes in diffs, fewer rewrites due to overcomplication, and clarifying questions come before implementation rather than after mistakes.
